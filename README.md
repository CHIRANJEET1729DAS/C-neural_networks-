# Project Description: Neural Network from Scratch in C++



Title: The "Neural-Network-but-Make-it-C++" Project

Welcome to the wild world of neural networks—where math meets magic, and we pretend we’re not just glorified number crunchers! In this project, we're diving headfirst into the caffeinated abyss of C++ to build a neural network from scratch. Yes, you read that right! No frameworks, no libraries—just pure, unadulterated code written by yours truly (with a side of caffeine and existential dread).

What’s the Vibe?

Imagine if Frankenstein had a programming hobby. We're stitching together neurons like it’s a DIY project—circuit boards and binary biceps included! The aim? To create a neural network that can do all the things you’ve heard about on TikTok but have no clue how to explain at parties. From predicting your friends’ questionable life choices to guessing whether pineapple belongs on pizza (it doesn’t, by the way), our neural net is ready to tackle it all.

Features That’ll Make You Go “Whoa”:

Feedforward Fun: Watch in awe as your data passes through layers, like a VIP line at the hottest club. Each neuron processes inputs like it’s deciding what outfit to wear, complete with activation functions to determine its mood.

Backpropagation Drama: Just like a reality TV show, this part involves a lot of crying (errors) and drama (updating weights). We’ll backtrack through the layers, adjusting weights until our network is as flawless as that influencer’s airbrushed selfie.

Error Logging: Track our journey of mistakes! We’ll document our epic fails (aka errors) in a file, because what’s a project without a little self-reflection? Spoiler alert: it’ll be a rollercoaster of cringe-worthy outputs.

Graphing Glory: Plotting our error over epochs like a heart rate monitor during finals week! Is it a gradual decline, or did we just take a nosedive into the abyss? Either way, we’re ready to visualize our struggles!

Why C++?

Why not? It’s like choosing to cook gourmet meals when instant noodles are on the table. Sure, it takes longer, but the satisfaction of knowing you actually understand pointers and memory management? Chef's kiss! Plus, who doesn't want to flex their C++ skills and make all the Python devs weep quietly in their code editors?

In Conclusion:

Join me on this adventurous journey where we’ll build a neural network that’s as much about the experience as it is about the outcome. Expect laughs, tears, and plenty of debugging. So, grab your keyboards, and let’s build something that’s definitely not just a glorified calculator—it's a neural network, baby! 🎉
